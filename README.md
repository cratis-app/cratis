## Features

### Outliner capability

Cratis is an outliner. An outliner is just a specialized type of text editor that is used to create/edit outlines, which are text files which follow a tree structure for organization. Each line is rendered as a bullet point that can be nested for structure.

### Bi-directional links

Cratis allows you to use bi-directional links to connect your notes! Type the name of another note between double square brackets or following a hashtag.

Ex/
- ```[[Another note]]```
- ```#Testing```

### Restructuring

Indent your current line by pressing ```Tab``` or shift it back a level with ```Shift+Tab```.

Re-order your points with drag and drop.

### Daily Journal ![Journal](https://cdn.josephtalon.ca/images/Cratis/calendar.svg)

Cratis automatically creates a daily note that goes into your "journal" every day you open the app. From here, you can insert any thoughts you have throughout the day and start building your network.

### View all notes and connections ![Network](https://cdn.josephtalon.ca/images/Cratis/network.svg)

View and navigate all your notes and their connections with the network view.

### Saved Locally as .md

Every file in the network is saved locally using [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) format.
